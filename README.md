# gcu (go check updates)

Due to following the [semantic version number](https://semver.org/), Go will not actively update the major version when checking and updating dependencies, and Go does not provide us with optional dependency update items. When updating, either all of them are updated or none of them are updated.

But this tool makes up for these deficiencies.

- It provides update checking for major versions
- Visual update selection
- Colored version number distinguishing hints
